# 🎯 PostgreSQL DBA Multi-Agent System - Complete Test Scenarios Guide

## 📋 Overview

This comprehensive guide provides test scenarios to validate all capabilities of your PostgreSQL DBA Multi-Agent system. Each scenario is designed to test specific agent abilities and inter-agent collaboration.

## 🗂️ Test Environment Status

After running all SQL scripts, your test database contains:

### **Data Volume:**
- **13 schemas** with realistic e-commerce, analytics, and audit data
- **666 orders** with items spanning 6 months
- **1,000+ products** with categories and inventory
- **24,000+ analytics events** from user sessions
- **100,000+ performance test records**
- **500+ product reviews** from customers

### **Intentional Issues Created:**
- **Performance Problems:** Missing indexes, slow queries, cache pressure
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Weak permissions, exposed data, dangerous functions
- **Maintenance Issues:** Obsolete statistics, unused indexes, configuration problems
- **Schema Issues:** Suboptimal designs, missing constraints

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start Test Scenarios

### **🔥 Emergency Scenarios (High Priority)**

#### **1. Database Performance Crisis**
```
"Our database has become extremely slow in the last hour. Users are complaining about timeouts. What's happening and how do we fix it immediately?"
```
**Expected Agent Response:**
- Performance Agent identifies slow queries in pg_stat_statements
- Detects missing indexes on frequently queried tables
- Recommends immediate index creation
- Suggests query optimizations

#### **2. Security Breach Alert**
```
"We suspect a security breach. Can you audit our database security and identify any vulnerabilities or unauthorized access patterns?"
```
**Expected Agent Response:**
- Security Agent scans for weak permissions
- Identifies exposed sensitive data in public schema
- Detects dangerous SECURITY DEFINER functions
- Reports authentication weaknesses

#### **3. Database Space Critical**
```
"Our database is running out of space. What's consuming the most storage and what can we do immediately?"
```
**Expected Agent Response:**
- Maintenance Agent analyzes table sizes
- Identifies bloated tables needing VACUUM
- Finds unused indexes consuming space
- Recommends cleanup strategies

## 🎯 Specialized Agent Test Scenarios

### **🚀 Performance Agent Scenarios**

#### **Scenario P1: Query Performance Analysis**
```
"Analyze the current query performance and identify the top 10 slowest queries with optimization recommendations."
```
**What to Test:**
- Identifies slow queries from pg_stat_statements
- Provides execution time analysis
- Suggests specific index recommendations
- Analyzes query patterns and hot spots

#### **Scenario P2: Index Optimization Review**
```
"Review our database indexes. Which ones are missing, unused, or redundant?"
```
**What to Test:**
- Detects missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- Identifies unused indexes consuming space
- Finds redundant indexes with similar definitions
- Recommends index consolidation strategies

#### **Scenario P3: Cache and Memory Analysis**
```
"Our database seems to have poor cache hit ratios. Analyze memory usage and buffer cache performance."
```
**What to Test:**
- Analyzes shared_buffers hit ratio
- Identifies cache pressure issues
- Reviews work_mem and other memory settings
- Suggests configuration optimizations

#### **Scenario P4: Blocking Sessions Investigation**
```
"We're experiencing lock contention. Identify current blocking sessions and suggest solutions."
```
**What to Test:**
- Detects current lock conflicts
- Identifies blocking and blocked sessions
- Analyzes lock wait patterns
- Suggests application-level solutions
